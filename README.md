# POS_Tagging_Using_Deep_Learning_and_CRF
The project was done using Pytorch.
The project deals with creating a Parts of Speech Tagger for English and Norwegian. We start off by creating a simple Hidden Markov Model 
that is used in tandem with the Viterbi-Trellis Algorithm.
We then move onto using Deep Learning models such as LSTM's and Bidrectional LSTMS combined with Conditional Random Fields to improve 
sequence predictions. Both word and character level features are incroporated.
